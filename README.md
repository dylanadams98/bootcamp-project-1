# Description of the project

The challenge of this project was to work collaboratively with other developers to create a project that solves a real-world problem. The project did it have a user story or an acceptance criterion. The project needed to fulfil the following requirements: use CSS, be interactive, use at least two server-side API’s, client storage, does not use alerts, be responsive, have a polished UI, have a clean repository.

# Technologies used

The following technologies were used within the code to achieve the desired website:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Day JS
- Chart JS
- Local Storage
- Polygon API
- News API

# APIs

For the project, the two API’s that were used are Polygon which is a stock market API that gathers real time stock prices. We combined it with a News API’s that enabled data from thew news about that specific ticker. By combing the two data’s from these specific API’s it enables the user to access a specific ticker and the news about that ticker in line with price discovery. As the breaking news come in, stock prices react. This will enable the user to decide how stock prices will be affected, thus thinking about their next investment.
