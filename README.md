# bootcamp-project-1
The challenge of this project was to work collaboratively with other developers to create a project that’s solves a real-world problem. The project did not have a user story or an acceptance criteria. The project needed to fulfil the following requirements: Use CSS, be interactive, use at least two server-side API’s, client storage, does not use alerts, be responsive, have a polished UI, have a clean repository.

For the project, the two API’s that were used were; Polygon (ttps://polygon.io), a stock market API that allowed access to real time stock prices and historical and News API (https://newsapi.org/) that enabled data from the news about that specific stock/company. By combing the two data’s from these specific API’s it enables the user to access a specific stock and the news, in line with price discovery. As the breaking news come in, stock prices react. This will enable the user to decide how stock prices will be affected, thus thinking about their next investment. 

ChartJS was used in this project to give the user a clear view of the stock and the date and time so the user can see the trend of the stock. The news is displayed next to the chart so the trend is more visible.
